Current diversified expansion techniques either make use of external knowledge sources to explicitly model the various aspects and their relationships underlying the user query or implicitly model query aspects. However these techniques assume query aspects to be independent of each other. We propose a unified framework that produces diversified query expansions in a completely implicit manner while also considering the relationships between query aspects. In particular, the framework identifies query aspects and their relationships by making use of the semantic properties of context phrases that occur within the top-ranked retrieved documents for the supplied user query, and maps them onto a Mutating Markov Chain model to generate a diverse ordering of query aspects. We test our framework against a set of ambiguous and faceted queries used in the NTCIR-12 IMine-2 Task and through an extensive empirical analysis, we show that our framework consistently outperforms existing implicit diversified query expansion algorithms. The utility of our algorithm truly comes up in the second set of experiments where we generate diversified query expansions for a retrieval engine indexing documents from specific scientific domains. Even in such a niche scenario our algorithm consistently provides robust results and performs better than other implicit approaches.",55,An implicit aspect modelling framework for diversity focused query expansion,Article,1,2020-10-01

The method is based on the in-situ reduction of chloroauric acid to form gold nanoparticles. A chromatographic paper was patterned using a wax printer. Chloroauric acid was drop-cast onto the reagent zone. In the presence of bilirubin, gold(III) ions are reduced and form gold nanoparticles. This leads to a color change from yellow to purple. The intensity of the purple color (peak at 530 nm) increases with bilirubin concentration in the 5.0 to 1000 mg L−1 range. The detection limit is 1.0 mg L−1. For the quantification of bilirubin, images were captured using a digital camera, and data were processed with the help of machine learning-based supervised prediction using Random Forest classification.

Indoor localization using WiFi is gaining ubiquitous usage owing to its simplicity and inexpensiveness. A conventional method of localization is trilateration, which can be accomplished using signal strength or time of flight of a radio signal between receiver and transmitter. However, trilateration is prone to errors in accuracy that can occur due to various factors. A common reason for the failure of trilateration is due to the errors in distance estimation resulting in a poor quality of trilateration. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted adaptive location estimation (WALE) algorithm. The proposed WALE algorithm provides an accurate localization in comparison to trilateration by taking into account the quality and properties of the circle overlaps. Based on the overlap properties a distance re-estimation and classification of points based on whether they are trilaterable is performed. A maximum likelihood estimation over a weighted grid of this region provides the location estimate. Our experiments over real indoor test-beds have demonstrated that our algorithm provides high accuracies with high stability in comparison to other algorithms. We achieve high accuracies ranging from 1.20 to 2.20 m in majority of the cases and an average of 2.98 m in a large office space with a standard deviation of 1.65.",10,WALE: a weighted adaptive location estimation algorithm,Article,8,2019-07-01

Calibration-free techniques for WiFi signal strength based indoor localization can help make indoor localization systems scalable, cost-effective and easy to deploy. However, distance estimation errors and environmental factors affect the accuracy of non-calibration solutions like trilateration significantly, and addressing the accuracy issue is critical. To help improve accuracy, localization over dual-band WiFi (IEEE 802.11n) which uses both 2.4Â GHz and 5Â GHz bands is a potential alternative. This paper proposes a novel adaptive, weighted trilateration technique that uses the behavior of these two bands under different conditions. An iterative heuristic approach based on the characterization of the behavior of the bands is employed to determine the most likely position of a smart phone. Additionally optimization strategies are applied to improve the time complexity of this approach. Experiments conducted in different indoor environments show that our approach performs better than other non-calibration signal strength based approaches in terms of accuracy, and also reduces the worst case error.",11474 LNCS,A Dynamic Weighted Trilateration Algorithm for Indoor Localization Using Dual-Band WiFi,Conference Paper,8,2019-01-01
5,"Dharanitejaswini, K.;Balasubramanian, Vidhya",Journal,186-199,International Journal of Wireless Information Networks,"Localization of assets is a critical component of smart building applications. This problem involves a lot of challenges and gets even more challenging when a consistently high level of accuracy has to be ensured while employing long-range RFID readers. In general, these antennas are placed so that there is some level of overlap of their ranges of influence, in order to support asset tracking with high precision. However, it is desirable to reduce the level of overlap when employing multiple readers for large-scale asset tracking, due to the high cost of these RFID readers and antennas. In such scenarios, it is important to maintain accuracy while increasing the coverage area of the readers, and for this a robust localization algorithm is necessary. This paper describes a novel hybrid indoor localization algorithm that combines the transmission power level control and the signal strength information in an intelligent manner to locate assets accurately. The algorithm does not require much calibration and is easily scalable. Additionally, it allows for both coarse and fine-grained location estimation depending on application requirements. Our experiments in real indoor environments, and with different degrees of overlap between long-range RFID antennas show that our algorithm provides higher accuracy in comparison to other algorithms, and is also consistent.",25,A Scalable and Hybrid Location Estimation Algorithm for Long-Range RFID Systems,Article,2,2018-06-01

Such systems must therefore provide services to support the learning needs of their users. When a retrieval system shows how its documents relate to each other semantically, a user gets the liberty to choose from different material, and direct his/her study in a focused manner. This calls for a model that identifies types of document relationships, that need to address different aspects of learning. This article defines three such types and a unique statistical model that can automatically identify them in technical/scientific documents. The model defines measures to quantify the degree of relatedness based on distinct statistical patterns exhibited by the common terms in a pair of documents. This approach does not strictly require a knowledge base or hypertext for identifying the characteristic relationship between two documents. Such a statistical model can be extended to build further relatedness types and can be used alongside various other techniques in digital library recommendation engines.

Statistically generated semantic networks are simple representations whose semantic power is yet to be completely explored. Though, these semantic networks are created with simple statistical measures without much overhead, they have the potential to express the semantic relationship between concepts. In this paper, we explore the capability of such networks and enhance them with concept hierarchies to serve as better knowledge representations. The concept hierarchies are built based on the level of importance of concepts. The level of importance/coverage of a concept within the given set of documents has to be taken into account to build an effective knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a domain-independent, graph based approach for identifying the level of importance of each concept from the statistically generated semantic network which represents the entire document set. Insights about the depth of every concept is obtained by analysing the graph theoretical properties of the statistically generated semantic network. A generic concept hierarchy is created using a greedy strategy, and the original semantic network is reinforced with this concept hierarchy.

In this paper, we address the challenge of localization and retrieval of objects in cluttered environments using passive RFID tags, by developing a novel indoor path loss translational model that considers the signal properties across the clutter. The proposed InPLaCE RFID system estimates the position of the object within a clutter by employing a robust translation model that accounts for the properties of the clutter and helps compensate for estimation errors over existing path loss models.

Indoor environments are dynamic in nature because of the objects present in it. To capture the essence of the indoor environment, it is essential to perform an object level mapping of an indoor space. This is because an object has the potential to alter the map of an indoor environment. Mapping a huge indoor environment could prove to be costly in terms of time with high infrastructure dependency. This compels us to find a simple solution in terms of cost, time and reliability to build an indoor map. The proposed solution should have minimal infrastructure dependence, so that it can be used in situations like disaster and rapid response scenarios, where the available infrastructure is minimal and time is of essence. We propose a Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) based approach which performs an object level mapping of the indoor environment using a portable RFID reader, RFID Ultra High Frequency(UHF) passive tags and inertial navigation sensors(INS). This approach identifies each object in the indoor environment using one or more passive tags. A novel algorithm has been developed which accurately maps the objects present in the indoor space.

However, the accuracy is limited by the freshness of the radio map, which is used for localization. Over time this radio map might be incompatible due to the changes in signal strength, a consequence of the dynamic nature of the environment. Therefore, repeated radio map calibration becomes a necessity. Currently radio maps are either manually calibrated, use additional infrastructure or complex algorithms to account for the radio map errors. There is therefore a need for a methodology to update the radio map with minimal additional overhead. This paper proposes a crowdsourcing approach which uses data collected from users of the localization system to maintain the freshness of the radio map. This approach leverages inertial sensors present in commonly used handheld devices, like mobile phones and tablets using which, a trajectory of the path of each user is computed. This trajectory is then coupled with the knowledge of the physical map under consideration to get the real time Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values at the reference points (RPs). A novel cluster based RSSI propagation policy is proposed where the real time RSSI values obtained are propagated within the clusters.
